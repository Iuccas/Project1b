# **Good Morning! Welcome to a simple list of facts about myself.**

1. I consider myself quite religious, being one of Jehovah's Witnesses. 
2. I am currently 20 years old at the time of writing this; I will be graduating in about a year if all goes according to plan. 
3. I chose CIT over Computer Science because I did not want to deal with the math involved (even though I already took Calc 1).
4. I kind of wish we got a group project for this semester. Not because I wanted to cruise by (which does help a bit) but because I wanted to bring out the best in others. I feel like I can provide a good enough presence that motivates people to perform better in class and I was kind of looking forward to that. But individual projects are cool too. :)
