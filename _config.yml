# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  I am currently editing this website at 2:23PM because I slept my entire morning away. This testsite is merely a way to test out whether I can access my website. If you can see this, apparently you can.
  Now, this is the second edit. It is now 5:20PM which means I took about 3 hours to get this .yml file onto my github. After a lot of thinking/troubleshooting, I was able to do it. So here is the second edit. 
  I should be able to finish this by today.
baseurl: "getcancelledtm" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "" # the base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com
